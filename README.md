# dotrun

A dotfiles-friendly Bash script manager (CLI: `drun`)
Inspired by dotfile tools like yadm and chezmoi, but for handy, portable scripts!

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jvPalma/dotrun/main/install-dotrun.sh | bash
````

Or, clone and run manually.

Usage
```bash
drun add folder/my_script

drun list

drun my_script

See more in the script or with drun --help.
