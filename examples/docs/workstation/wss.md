# wss â€” Start Cloud Workstation

Starts your Google Cloud Workstation if it's currently stopped, with intelligent status checking to avoid unnecessary operations.

## Synopsis

```bash
dr workstation/wss
```

## Description

Initiates the startup process for your configured cloud workstation. The script first checks the current status and only starts the workstation if it's currently stopped, preventing unnecessary restart operations.

Features:

- **Status validation**: Checks current state before attempting startup
- **Idempotent operation**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Clear feedback**: Provides status messages for all scenarios
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of startup failures

## Usage

```bash
# Start workstation if stopped
dr workstation/wss

# Use in automation scripts
if [[ "$(dr workstation/wsl)" != "RUNNING" ]]; then
  dr workstation/wss
fi
```

## Behavior

### Workstation Already Running

```bash
$ dr workstation/wss
Workstation is already running.
```

### Workstation Starting

```bash
$ dr workstation/wss
Starting workstation...
# Waits for startup completion
Workstation started successfully.
```

### Workstation Stopped

```bash
$ dr workstation/wss
Workstation is stopped. Starting now...
# Initiates startup process
```
